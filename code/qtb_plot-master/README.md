# QTB Plot

Shortcut matplotlib parameter set to give consistent plots within the institute.

Currently, three contexts for plotting are available:  

``` python
qtb_plot.set("notebook")
qtb_plot.set("paper")
qtb_plot.set("talk")
```

The easiest way of installing the package is to cd into the package folder and to install it locally with
`pip install -e .`

A short introductory jupyter notebook is supplied as well.
